# TrainRelief
An app made completely from scratch as a project in Hyper Island Stockholm.</br>
The idea was to display data on train delays to the users daily commute and give the user an option of trying a meditation technique to calm down if/when there are delays. </br>

## The Process

A lot of time was spent on the design, to have a calming colour scheme and to have the UI intuitive. It was to be kept simple and very straightforward. The project was 6 weeks, 2 spent on research, 2 on ideation and design and 2 on coding and development. We followed agile methodology and had a SCRUM board for the tasks. We collaborated by coding in components and taking on respective user stories from the scrum board.

## Running the app locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
